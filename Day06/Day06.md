Today, we will be practicing writing zero-knowledge circuits. The circuits can be found in the `Circuits` directory, organized according to the suggested order for the puzzles, which is as follows:

- Addition
- Equality
- NotEqual
- Poseidon
- ForLoop
- Power
- Range

If you are interested in interacting with the circuits, you can do so in zkrepl.
